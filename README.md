### Pulse expansion:
  1. Ensure that files nrau.m, nrag.m, niau.m and niag.m are installed and visible in matlab folder.
  2. Run the 3D model for either spheres, cylinders or prisms.
  3. Run the absorption calculation. Make sure that the data from the 3D models hasn't been cleared.
  
notes: Choose between gold or silver nanoparticles by choosing permitivitty on line 61 in the absorption calculation code, the direction of the E-field is chosen on line 58. The prism model can be rotated on line 278 in its source code.
